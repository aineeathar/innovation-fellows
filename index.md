secondary_headline: Changing up Local Government
secondary_lede_markdown: The City of Austin's Design, Technology, and Innovation Fellows program provides an opportunity for Austin’s passionate and civic-minded designers and developers to bring the principles, values, and practices of the technology sector into government.
secondary_paragraph_markdown: Inspired by the success of programs at the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://cfpb.github.io/), [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/), and the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov/), we partner with departments throughout the city to tackle some of their biggest challenges.
