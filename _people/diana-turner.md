bio: |
  I joined the DTI Fellows because after preaching to my UX students the power of human-centered design in making people's needs heard and represented, I realized I needed to put my words into action, and seek out work that was more impactful than making websites for sandwiches. Power to the people; let's build solutions with the citizens that we serve.
