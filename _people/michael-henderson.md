  I am excited build community on behalf of all residents in our beloved City of Austin. All of my colleagues are  innovators, technologist, and human centered designers, working with these fellows align with my core values of education, empathy, entrepreneurship, and empowerment. How can we use our tech skill sets to move the needed forward in our city services? I believe many of those answers can be found in our Innovation Office.
