bio: |
  What drew me to be a fellow? Meaning. And also opportunity. Meaning: in the sense that I am contributing to something explicitly imperative and much larger than myself. Opportunity: in the sense that I get to explore design’s relationship within government, where I believe there is a natural compatibility… That’s pretty awesome.
