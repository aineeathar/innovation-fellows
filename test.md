## Introduction

The design style guide is a library of the site's design components, including color palette, typography, and iconography. Our library builds off of the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/).

## Components

### Buttons
Buttons can be used as more prominent calls to action than a link alone.

#### Primary buttons
These are used for main actions and should be used sparingly. Do not use two primary buttons side-by-side.
<div class="button_wrapper">
  <button>Default</button>
  <button class="usa-button-hover">Hover</button>
  <button class="usa-button-active">Active</button>
  <button class="usa-button-focus">Focus</button>
</div>

#### Outline buttons
These are used for supplemental actions and can be used alone or paired with a primary button.
<div class="button_wrapper">
  <button class="usa-button-outline" type="button">Default</button>
    <button class="usa-button-outline usa-button-hover">Hover</button>
  <button class="usa-button-outline usa-button-active">Active</button>
  <button class="usa-button-outline usa-button-focus">Focus</button>
</div>

#### Inverse outline buttons
These are used for supplemental actions and can be used alone or paired with a primary button.
<div class="button_wrapper button-wrapper-dark">
  <button class="usa-button-outline-inverse" type="button">Default</button>
  <button class="usa-button-outline-inverse usa-button-hover">Hover</button>
  <button class="usa-button-outline-inverse usa-button-active">Active</button>
  <button class="usa-button-outline-inverse usa-button-focus">Focus</button>
</div>
