bio: |
  I joined the City of Austin's Office of Innovation as portfolio manager in 2015. I help organize groups and build effective teams to solve difficult challenges--and get to action. A graduate of The University of Texas at Austin and The George Washington University, I previously worked as a consultant with Federal Government agencies focused on improving performance, opening government, and using data in decision-making.
