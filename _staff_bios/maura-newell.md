bio: |
  I'm interested in understanding humans— their behaviors, interactions, and communities— and exploring what makes people 'tick.' I believes that to achieve sustainable progress and change in the world, we must use a human-centered, empathetic approach in the development of interventions, services, programs, and policies. I have been advocating for human rights since 2011, and moved to Austin in 2014 to tackle homelessness as an AmeriCorps permanent supportive housing case manager.
